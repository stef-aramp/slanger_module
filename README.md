# slanger_module
This is a python module that is used to rephrase more than 100 slang words and acronyms. These words are met in social media such as twitter, youtube, instagram etc. Moreover, some words are explicit!

Attention, this is not a dictionary with slang-word explanation. 
e.g. “bruh” is replaced with “brother” NOT with “Used by african Americans Males in everyday vocabulary or to greet one another”
