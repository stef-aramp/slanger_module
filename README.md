# slanger_module
This is a python module that is used to rephrase slang words and acronyms. These words are met in social media such as twitter, youtube, instagram etc. 

Attention, this is not a dictionary with slang-word explanation. 
e.g. “bruh” is replaced with “brother” NOT with “Used by african Americans Males in everyday vocabulary or to greet one another”
